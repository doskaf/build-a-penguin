# TODO

1. Make sure a logged in user is not able to go to the login or signup pages without logging out first (maybe redirect to /penguins if logged_in)
2. In your /penguins page, have a link to that penguin's show page. If you wanna get fancy, only show that link for a user who is logged in AND owns that penguin
